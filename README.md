# All_About_Me

		 * 1. All about me
		 * 
		 * Create Strings named [myName], [myEyes], [myTeeth], and [myHair]. Create
		 * integers named [myAge] and [myHeight].
		 * 
		 * Use the following values for your variables [myName] = "Shahparan" [myAge] =
		 * 31 [myHeight] = 175 [myEyes] = "Black" [myTeeth] = "White" [myHair] = "Black"
		 * 
		 * Print out the following lines:
		 * 
		 * //Output Let's talk about [myName]. They're [myHeight] inches tall. They're
		 * [myAge] years old. Huh, that's older than I expected... They have [myEyes]
		 * eyes and [myHair] hair. Their teeth are usually [myTeeth], but it depends on
		 * the coffee. Alright, this is pretty boring. Let's stop talking about
		 * [myName].
